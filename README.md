# C (Strings)

**Hello everyone!**

My name is [Stefano Caramagno](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefanocaramagno), and I'm pleased to present this repository containing exercises on **strings** implemented in **C programming**. <br>
These exercises were completed as part of the **Foundations of Computer Science** course during my [Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering](https://www.dieei.unict.it/corsi/l-8-inf) at the [University of Catania](https://www.unict.it).

## üåç Context

This repository includes a series of exercises focused on string manipulation in C programming. <br>
The exercises cover string operations, including concatenation, comparison, and searching within strings.

## üéØ Objectives

- **String Manipulation**: Develop skills in handling and manipulating strings in C. 
- **String Operations**: Implement various string operations such as concatenation, comparison, and searching.
- **Practical Applications**: Apply string manipulation techniques to solve practical problems.

## üìÇ Contents

- **String Basics**: Exercises on declaring, initializing, and manipulating strings.
- **String Functions**: Exercises on using standard string functions (e.g., strcpy, strcat, strcmp).
- **String Algorithms**: Exercises on implementing algorithms for string searching.
